#summary How to build kGUI and it's sample programs
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Building for Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio =

open the kgui solution file in Visual Studio
then press f5 to build

= Building for Windows using MinGW =

open the mingw shell

./configure
make other
make

To build the samples just go into the sample directory and

cd samples
cd (name of sample to build)

= Building for Linux =

For complete beginners, you will need to install the compiler and build enviroment, and also subversion to get download the source code. 

apt-get install build-essential
apr-get install subversion

The linux build uses two external libraries:
XWindows - for the window manager / screen / mouse / keyboard
Cups - for printing

apt-get install xlibs-static-dev
on  some systems the above is called xorg-dev

apt-get install libcupsys2-dev
apt-get install libcupimage2-dev

if you are using the mysql code in kgui then you need to also have the mysql code

apt-get install mysql-server
apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev

Once you have the packages installed then you can start the building

./configure
make other
make

* currently it will build until it gets to matrixsll and then it dies since the matrixssl makefile is currently not working with windows, you can just ignore this since it is the last thing to be build.

To build the samples just go into the sample directory and

cd samples
cd (name of sample to build)
make

= Building Macintosh =
